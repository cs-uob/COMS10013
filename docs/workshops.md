# Workshops

The workshops for this unit continue in the same style as Mathematics A.

For AY 2023/24, the workshops take place in QB F101a (Bill Brown suite) at the following times:

  - Mondays, 13:00-14:50
  - Thursdays, 13:00am-14:50

## Attendance

This unit has an attendance hurdle exactly like Mathematics A.

  - You are expected to attend at least 19 of 20 mandatory workshops (2 each in the teaching weeks 13-17 and 19-23). 
  - The hurdle is 15 of 20 mandatory workshops. Failing the hurdle means you automatically fail the unit.
  - If you are unwell, you may self-certify your absence on the day (e-mail coms-info for details) and then the workshop counts as attended.
  - Since the expectation is 19 workshops, attending only 14 is still a fail.

We will take attendance as follows:

  - In the in-person workshops, by a combination of paper sign-in sheets and UCard readers, so make sure you bring your UCard along.
  - In the online workshops, the TAs will take attendance. They may ask you each a maths question before signing you in, and you must turn both microphone and camera on and attempt the question to get the attendance. You will still get attendance if you make a mistake, but you do need to make a reasonable attempt.

## Updates

  - The workshop on Monday 24 January (Week 13) is cancelled as per the e-mail you received. For attendance purposes, this counts as if everyone had _attended_ the workshop, so you are all already on +1 attendance.

    Please read the e-mail you got to learn more about the unit, and prepare for Thursday's workshop. You might want to revise your A-level vectors content too.
