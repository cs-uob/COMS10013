# Assessment

This unit has an attendance hurdle: you need to attend 75% of mandatory workshops and pass the exam to get credit for the unit.

## Exam

The exam will be held online using blackboard and you will be able to
find it on the day by going to blackboard, selecting the unit, and then
selecting _Assessment, Submission and Feedback_ in the menu on the
left.

The exam will open on _Monday 14 June_ at _9:45am_ British time. The duration of the exam is 3 hours, with an extra 30 minutes of extra time added as a buffer. This means you should aim to be finished after 3 hours, not 3 hours and 29 minutes - the exam will shut after 3 hours and 30 minutes exactly and you will get no sympathy if you ask for "just one minute more".

If you have alternative exam arrangements, you start at the same time as everyone else but your end time will be displayed for you on the first page of the exam.

## Questions

The exam will consist of 24 questions, all equally weighted.

  - The first 12 questions will be on Linear Algebra.
  - The next 6 questions will be on Analysis.
  - The final 6 questions will be on Statistics.

The questions will be displayed one at time, but you will be able to
answer them in any order. The question pages will have forwards/back
buttons as well as a bar at the top called _Question Completion Status_
that you can use to jump to questions directly, and to see which
questions you have not answered yet. On the page for the final
question, there will be a button to submit the exam. You can only do
this once, so make sure you do not press it before you are sure that you
want to submit.

As a rough calculation, 24 questions in 180 minutes means 7.5 minutes
per question on average, so although everyone will have questions that
they find easier or harder, you can use this timing to help you plan when
to e.g. skip a question and come back to it later.

All exam questions will be automatically marked, but I will download and
manually check the answers as well. Question types can include:

  - Multiple choice: you need to pick exactly one answer from a list.
  - Multiple answer: you are given a list of options and need to mark each one as true or false. There can be any number of true options, including none.
  - Type one or more values: you will be shown a question with some text/number boxes and instructions on how to complete them.
  - Pick one or more values from dropdown boxes.

There will be no long answer or essay type questions.

## Number format

There will be lots of questions where you need to enter one or more numbers, because maths. 
It is important that you enter them as described in the question to keep the Blackboard marking code happy. 
For example, if you are asked to enter a number "with up to two decimal places" (hint: you will be asked this on the exam),

  - If you get 2.5671, enter `2.57`. Depending on the question, the correct answer might be defined as a range e.g. "accept [2.56, 2.58]". 
	- Do not round to two d.p. in your own calculations until the point where you enter the result. If you want to, you can work to two more d.p. than the question asks for in your intermediate results (so four in this case, e.g. for sin(15) in degrees write 0.2588 in your notes as you're working out), this should be sufficient to deal with rounding errors.
	- If you get an integer result, enter it without a decimal point e.g. `0` not `0.0`. 
	- Add a zero before the decimal point if needed, but not after, e.g. for 1/2 enter `0.5` not `.5` or `0.50`.
	- For a fraction, express as a decimal e.g. `0.33` not `1/3`.
	- If you get a negative number, add a leading minus sign with no spaces or brackets e.g. `-2` not `- 2` or `(-2)`. Maths doesn't care, but blackboard does.

On the blackboard page for Mathematics B, there is a "demo exam"
menu item on the left where you can practice the type of questions that
could come up, as well as get a feel for using the blackboard exam
interface.

## Pre-assessment Materials

There is no mock exam for this unit. For revision, we recommend you
use the problem sheets (and their solutions) as your main source of
exercises to solve and revise.

## Academic Integrity

From the university information:

> We expect you to maintain the highest standards of academic
> integrity, as set out in the University Policy on Academic Integrity
> and the Student Agreement.
>
>   - You must not collaborate or work with anyone else on your exam, either physically or virtually.
>   - The work submitted must be entirely your own.
>   - We will view any instances of collusion as cheating and will take them very seriously.
