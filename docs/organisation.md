# Unit organisation

## Schedule

We anticipate that this unit will run entirely online.

The general idea is the same as for Mathematics A: you prepare for each workshop by consuming the content (videos, lecture notes) beforehand and work on a problem sheet in the workshop itself.

Workshops are Tuesdays and Fridays from 2-4pm in Microsoft Teams. The Team for the unit will show automatically when you log in to Teams with your university account.

The Q&A session is Thursday from 2-3pm, also on Teams.

There may be the occasional class test or mock exam to help you get feedback on your progress.

The plan is to have 8 weeks of material with mandatory workshops and 4 weeks of optional drop-ins. We will adapt the schedule as neccessary, for example if people are falling behind we can introduce an extra catch-up week. The only certain things at the moment is that we will start in week 13 with Linear Algebra; week 17 will be a department-wide reading week (no new material, no workshops, possibly drop-ins) and week 24 will be a revision week (no new material, attendance optional).

## Attendance hurdle

Like Mathematics A, this unit has an attendance hurdle.

  * We expect a properly engaged student to attend _all_ mandatory workshops on this unit. We won't mind if you have at most one unauthorised absence for the whole unit though.
  * If you are unwell or have another good reason that you can't attend a workshop, you fill in the [self-certification for absence form](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/current-students/student-systems/) (choose "Engineering Student Forms" on that page). No evidence is required for this form, and self-certified workshops count as attended. If you have frequent self-certified absences then a tutor may get in contact with you, but this will be for support not discipline.
  * Some weeks will be drop-ins which are optional and do not count towards your attendance target.
  * The attendance hurdle is 75% of mandatory workshops, which we currently anticipate will mean 12 out of 16.

The hurdle is deliberately set lower than the attendance level we would expect of a properly engaged student. This means that "I _almost_ met the hurdle" is not a valid excuse.

TAs will take attendance in the workshops. To get marked as attending, you must

  - Be in your assigned group on Teams on time, and remain there at least until you have been told you are signed in. 
  - If a TA speaks to you, turn your microphone and camera on and reply to them - being logged in but not replying does not count.
  - If a TA asks you a maths question, try and answer it. You do not need to give the correct answer to get signed in, but you do need to attempt the question.
  - If you are late and miss the TA taking attendance, actively seek out another TA in the _Ask a TA_ channel, give your reason for being late, and then ask them to sign you in.

You may ask the TAs at any time during the workshops about how many workshops you have been signed in for so far.
Each TA will be supervising 2-3 groups in each workshop, so sometimes you group will get visited towards the very start of the workshop, and sometimes not until the second hour of the workshop. TAs have been instructed to tell their groups when they have finished taking attendance, but don't be afraid to ask if you're not sure if you're signed in yet or not.

## Prerequisites

We expect our students to know A-level mathematics to the level that would have got them an A* in a normal year. The parts of this particularly relevant for Mathematics B are, with the relevant part of this unit in brackets:

  - vectors (Linear Algebra)
  - integration and differentiation (Analysis)
  - differential equations (Analysis) although we will refresh this content in the unit when we come to it
  - statistics (Statistics, obviously)

We also assume that you remember the content of Mathematics A.

## Time planning

As a rough guide to time planning:

  1. The average student should spend just over 40 hours a week on average on work related to their course. If you are regularly spending much longer than that in first year and not getting the results you expect, you might want to seek advice on effective learning strategies at university. 
  2. In this teaching block, you have three units each worth 20 credits. This means on average you will spend 14 hours per week on each unit (assuming a 42-hour week), that is a bit more than a day and a half a week per unit - although in practice most students will have units that take them shorter or longer than others.
  3. The timetabled _synchronous_ hours - in this unit the workshops and drop-ins, in others maybe labs or problem classes - take up much less time than the 14 hours you are supposed to spend on the unit. In a normal year with timetabled lectures, the advice to students was to spend at least as much time again on each unit in self-study as you had contact hours for lectures and labs combined. This year with lectures replaced by _asynchronous_ material, e.g. you can read or watch it in your own time, your contact time in the workshops and drop-ins will make up only a tiny part of all the work you are expected to do for each unit: for Maths B, 4-5 hours out of 14 per week and even that only in 8 weeks out of 12.

## Contacts

Your main ways of getting help with the unit are:

  1. Ask a TA or staff member during the workshops.
  2. Come to a drop-in session.
  3. Post your question on the Teams group for the unit (including outside of workshop hours).
  4. Ask other members of your bubble, or other students that you know.

You must not e-mail unit staff individually with questions about the material, as if we answer in an e-mail then that answer only goes to one student and the others cannot see it, which is unfair. Instead of e-mailing, you should ask questions on the unit forum, where it takes us the same time to reply but the benefit for students is much greater as everyone can read the same explanation.

We do not offer extra private lessons for individual students. However, if you are a student with a registered disability, or from a widening participation background, there may be extra support that you can access through the university.

## Assessment and grades

To pass this unit, you must do two things:

  * Attend at least 75% of all mandatory workshops (including class tests and mock exams in workshop slots).
  * Attend and pass the exam in the summer. The pass mark is 40%, and if you achieve this then your unit mark will be your exam mark.

Class tests and mock exams are formative, which means they are only for feedback to you and they do not count towards your unit grade (taking them on time does count towards your attendance, though).
